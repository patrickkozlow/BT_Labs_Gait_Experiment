# BT_Labs_Gait_Experiment
Code and scripts used to conduct gait experiment to detect soft biometric cues

Repository is structured as follows:
1) C++ code used to interface with the Kinect v2 Camera, used to pull information from the camera & find the gait cycle + angles
3) Matlab script used to create and tabularize gait data from C++ output
3) Matlab script used to decode UPCV dataset
4) Script to merge the two datasets
